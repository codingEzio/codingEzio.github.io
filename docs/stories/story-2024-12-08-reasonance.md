## RESONANCE

The first time I tasted 1847, I was brushing my teeth in 2024.

Suddenly my mouth was full of rough bread and thin soup, eaten from a wooden bowl in a London workhouse. The taste of poverty and coal dust. Sarah's hunger became my hunger, her desperation my own.

That's how it started. Random sensory flashes across 177 years. The doctors called it temporal synaesthesia, but they couldn't explain why I kept experiencing memories that weren't mine. Couldn't explain Sarah's voice in my head, her emotions flooding my body.

"I feel you too," she whispered through time. "Your strange sweet drinks. The lights that never end. The constant noise."

We learned to control it gradually. I could slip into her body during the factory shifts, lending her my knowledge of machinery to avoid the dangerous gears. She would flow into mine during my programming job, her deft seamstress fingers flying across my keyboard.

But time didn't want us connected. Each sharing caused ripples - small changes that grew larger. When I helped her avoid a workplace accident, my grandfather's watch disappeared from my wrist. When she used my knowledge to organize a worker's protest, my sister started speaking with a different accent.

The paradoxes were unraveling both our timelines. We had to stop sharing or risk erasing ourselves entirely.

On our last connection, I sent her everything I could - technical knowledge, historical hindsight, hope for the future. She sent me her strength, her resilience, her unwavering spirit.

Now I taste mint toothpaste again, but sometimes, when I'm nearly asleep, I catch a ghost of bread and soup. And I know somewhere in time, Sarah tastes the future on her tongue.

We are separate. We are connected. We are resonating across centuries.
