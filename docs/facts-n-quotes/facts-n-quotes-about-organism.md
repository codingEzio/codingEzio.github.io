### How Do Chickens Have The Spare Resources To [Lay A Nutrient Rich Egg Every Day](https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/yp9nc5/eli5_how_do_chickens_have_the_spare_resources_to/ivieksb/)?

> They don’t have the spare resources. It takes a massive toll on their bodies.

> Wild chickens will lay 10-20 eggs a year. The breeds that lay roughly an egg a day have been naturally selected artificially selected to lay around 200 eggs a year. This is indeed impossible to sustain. In studies, the vast majority of laying hens have bone fractures because those resources weren’t spare. Their bodies can’t support this. The best equivalent (not perfect, but as a simple comparison) is if human women were bred until they have their heaviest day of a period every day. You can imagine that wouldn’t be sustainable.

> As a result the chickens inevitably burn out and can’t produce at that rate as their bodies deteriorate. And so once they’re not profitable, then they’re sent to the slaughterhouse.

### Who Once had been in that Head?

> My most vivid recollection is of one grocery store that, around the Christmas season, featured the severed head of a pig on a table in the middle of an aisle. If you chanced to approach it from the rear, you would see a flat cross-section showing all the inner structures of that pig’s neck, exactly as if it had been guillotined.

> I couldn’t help wondering, “Who once had been in that head? Who had lived there? Who had looked out through those eyes, heard through those ears? Who had this hunk of flesh really been? Was it a male or a female?” No answers came,
>
> It seemed to me that nobody else was facing the intense questions of life, death, and “porcinal identity” that this silent, still head provoked so powerfully and agitatedly inside mine.
