## One-liner

- If you can state exactly why something is "impossible", you are often close to a solution.
- 其实是你的情绪进入了死胡同，而不是人生进入了死胡同。
- Human as a LLM = Millions or more tokens in and out in an instant :P
- Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yes. Beauty is also in the processing capacity and modalities of the beholder.
- Abstraction is a path of least resistance, a form of mental laziness.
- 精神及其所有特征完全来自大脑及身体的其他部分组成的物质基础，以及身体和外界物理世界间的交互，其中没有任何非物质或无形的东西。
- 这个世界是隐喻式的，我们并非确凿无疑地生活在符号世界中，我们生活在色彩斑斓的隐喻中。固然不同的文化所对应的底层逻辑之间难以互通或相互转化，甚至不同的文化隐喻所导致的生活信念彼此抵牾，但人类仍然有共享的元认知（metacognition），这一元认知是维系多样化世界的最后屏障。
- After having been exposed to all the “normal” advice, you start to seek out deeper and deeper ideas in search of some sort of mental high. What happens is that you become a kind of self-help junkie.
- 如果你有真正的知识你就不会对信息（主要是垃圾信息）产生焦虑，信息是浅薄而表象的知识，比如推上吵来吵去的关于民主，自由，拥枪权之类的垃圾，就是典型的基于信息垃圾的观点之间的垃圾争吵。这些争吵在托马斯潘恩的小册子《常识》里全都简单明了的解释过了。99% 的参与争吵的人没有真的读过这本书，但他们都知道这本书里的只言片语，而这 99% 的人产生了互联网上 99% 的垃圾，制造了 99% 的信息焦虑。

### Brain Fart ~= Cache Miss

> We say “brain fart” when we should really say “cache miss.” The disproportionate occasional lags in information retrieval are a reminder of just how much we benefit the rest of the time by having what we need at the front of our minds.
>
> So as you age, and begin to experience these sporadic latencies, take heart: the length of a delay is partly an indicator of the extent of your experience. The effort of retrieval is a testament to how much you know. And the rarity of those lags is a testament to how well you’ve arranged it: keeping the most important things closest to hand.

### To say something is natural is that it EXISTS, but it doesn’t mean it SHOULD

> Naturalistic fallacy, which maintains that whatever exists should exist. The naturalistic fallacy confuses a scientific description of human behavior with a moral prescription for that behavior. In nature, however, there are diseases, plagues, parasites, infant mortality, and a host of other natural events that we try to eliminate or reduce. The fact that they do exist in nature does not imply that they should exist.

> Similarly, male sexual jealousy, which evolved in part as an adaptation to protect men’s certainty of their paternity, is known to damage women worldwide in the form of intimate partner violence, stalking, and occasionally murder. As a society, we may eventually develop methods for reducing male sexual jealousy and its dangerous manifestations.

### Memory Decline

> If the fundamental challenge of memory really is one of organization rather than storage, perhaps it should change how we think about the impact of aging on our mental abilities.
>
> Recent work by a team of psychologists and linguists led by Michael Ramscar at the University of Tübingen has suggested that what we call “cognitive decline”—lags and retrieval errors—may not be about the search process slowing or deteriorating, but (at least partly) an unavoidable consequence of the amount of information we have to navigate getting bigger and bigger.
>
> Regardless of whatever other challenges aging brings, older brains—which must manage a greater store of memories—are literally solving harder computational problems with every passing day.
>
> Through a series of simulations, the researchers showed that simply knowing more makes things harder when it comes to recognizing words, names, and even letters.
>> No matter how good your organization scheme is, having to search through more things will inevitably take longer. It’s not that we’re forgetting; it’s that we’re remembering. We’re becoming archives.

### Human Behaviors, either Biological or Environmental

> (We shall) divide human behavior into two separate categories, one biologically determined and the other environmentally determined. In fact, human action is inexorably a product of both.
>
> Every strand of DNA unfolds within a particular environmental and cultural context. Within each person’s life, social and phyPsical environments provide input to both the development and activation of evolved psychological adaptations. Every behavior is without exception a joint product of those mechanisms and their environmental influences.

### 每个人都搞砸了

> 作家 Anne Lamott 在 61 岁生日的前一天，写下了十二条关于人生真相的箴言，她把枯子发布在脸书上。人们都喜欢这个贴子井疯狂转发。TED 甚至邀请 Anne 就这十二条箴言做了一个演进。这是十二条里，我尤其喜欢这一句话：每个人都搞砸了，破碎了，粘人了，害怕了。每个人都是如此，即使是那些看起来最得心应手的人。她们比你想象的更像你一样。因此，不要将你的内在与别人的外在进行比较。

- 这句话让我想到了，我常听说的人生的三个阶段。第一阶段，你意识到父母只是普通人。第二阶段，你意识到自己只是普通人。第三阶段，你意识到你的孩子只是普通人。其实，人生还有第四个阶段。这时，你意识到每一个人，都是普通人。

> 想象一下你最羡慕的人，也许是工作顺利的同事、美满幸福的同学、或者是爸妈常夸的那个表哥。不用羡慕她们，因为光鲜的背后，她们都在经历自己的迷茫和挣扎。
>
> 想象一下你最怨恨的人，无论是工作上处处针对你的同事，还是网络上无理攻击你的陌生人。不用怨恨她们，因为看似无理的冒犯，只是她们释放自己痛苦的方式。
>
> 想象一下你所看低的人，也许她们胸无大志、浑浑噩噩，也许她们纵情声色、肆意安为。不用看低她们，也许她们经历过不为人知的故事。况且，谁说快乐和满足，会有高下之分。

- 每个人都在经历同样的痛苦、迷茫和挣扎，无论她看起来多么健康、坚强、乐观。每一个人 (如果我们能看到她们的内心世界)，都搞砸了。
