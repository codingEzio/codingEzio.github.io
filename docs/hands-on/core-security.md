### Attack

> I didn't set up a realistic attack lab for this for actually seeing the effects of the attacks locally. IMO, for this kind of concepts that were quite easy to understand, I'm leaning more to practice directly based on the real-world attacking scripts (just like [thesc1entist](https://github.com/thesc1entist)'s script below). Also, I might need to learn about [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) to see the processes in real-time.
>> Also, there were even more types, more attack vectors of DNS attacks. Not going to cover them here, yet.
