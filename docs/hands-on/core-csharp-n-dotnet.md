Boxing v Unboxing, Value v Reference Type
Conversion between value type and reference types, boxing bridging them together to provide a uniform type system that were all derived from Object.
Sometimes we store value type within reference type variables, we need boxing to put it in, and unboxing it when in need of accessing it.
Value of value type copies over value itself on the stack. Whereas reference types were stored on the heap.
If we were to use Generics, explicitly declaring the types being stored, we no longer need the boxing/unboxing.

Destructors
`~ClassName { clean up }`
`: IDisposable + public void Dispose`
`using (..) {}  d// auto clean up`
`try .. catch .. finally ..`

const v readonly
literally constant, limited val types
Freer, all kinds of types

this v base
base calls mother class‚Äô thingy
this calls current class‚Äô methods/vars

generics v overload
generics ensure uniformity
overloading get you more than handling different types, but also methods with different length of parameters

List
ICollection<T> üëâ IList<T> üëâ List
Each with different set of methods impl_ed

Copy v Clone
One shallow, one deep
One gets a new obj that points to the same memory address of the object you are copying,
