### Resources

- [Signal Handling (The GNU C Library)](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Signal-Handling.html)

### Concepts Simplified

> **WIP**

- A form of IPC
- A way to communicate between processes
- A way to setup **listen up, X happens, do Y**
- A way to setup **if receives signal X, call function Y**
- Mostly used and seen in *program termination*
