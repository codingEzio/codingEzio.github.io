- I used to use full-fledged VMs
- I wanna try running a full Linux OS in/as a Docker container
  - Real Linux instead of the macOS
  - Easier to manage (Docker API)
  - Lighter (I don't need the GUI)

-----

setup the base environment

- choose a distro with proper version
  - I'm most familiar with Ubuntu
  - I gotta choose a LTS version
  - I chose *Ubuntu 22.04 LTS* (data below is based on this version)
    - Not too new (I got no time to check potential breaking changes on various aspects)
    - End of { standard support: 2027/06, life: 2023/04 }
  - data on the LTS
    - it was based on the first version (cuz there were still Ubuntu 22.04.*\**)
    - list of releases on the [official website](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases)
