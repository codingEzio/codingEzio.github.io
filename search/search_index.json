And somehow the end result is entirely magical. What the Current Situation of Alignment is People often associate alignment with some complicated questions about human values, or jump to political controversies, but deciding on what behaviors and values to instill in the model, while important, is a separate problem. The primary problem is that for whatever you want to instill the model (including ensuring very basic things, like \u201cfollow the law\u201d!) we don\u2019t yet know how to do that for the very powerful AI systems we are building very soon. What's LLM in the landscape of AI field? On LLM (Large Language Model) Language models don't actually understand the world, they understand relationships between lexemes, they aren't intelligent in the same way that a motion picture isn't really moving. \u4ec0\u4e48\u7b97\u662f AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) \u6211\u89c9\u5f97 Intelligence \u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u6839\u636e\u8ba4\u77e5\uff08cognition\uff09\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08knowledge\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u5df2\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u8fa8\u8ba4\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\u6211\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u53ea\u866b\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u866b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u7fc5\u8180\u3001\u89e6\u89d2\u3001\u80a2\u8282\u63a8\u6d4b\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u662f\u67d0\u79cd\u7532\u866b\u3002ChatGPT \u5df2\u7ecf\u53ef\u4ee5\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e86\u3002\u6211\u4e0d\u671f\u5f85 AI \u4e5f\u4f1a\u6709\u6076\u5fc3\u3001\u5bb3\u6015\u3001\u62ff\u8d77\u62cd\u5b50\u6765\u6253\u6b7b\u866b\u5b50\u8fd9\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002 We Need A Capable Successor to RLHF Even now, AI labs already need to pay expert software engineers to give RLHF ratings for ChatGPT code\u2014the code current models can generate is already pretty advanced!

Challenges faced by computers and human minds alike: how to manage finite space, finite time, limited attention, unknown unknowns, incomplete information, and an unforeseeable future; how to do so with grace and confidence; and how to do so in a community with others who are all simultaneously trying to do the same. \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5148\u9a71\u9a6c\u6587\u00b7\u660e\u65af\u57fa\u8fd9\u6837\u8bf4\u9053\uff1a\u201c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd1\u4ee3\u79d1\u5b66\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u601d\u60f3\u840c\u82bd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u2018believe\u2019\uff08\u76f8\u4fe1\uff09\u3001\u2018know\u2019\uff08\u77e5\u9053\uff09\u3001\u2018mean\u2019\uff08\u610f\u5473\u7740\uff09\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8bcd\u8bed\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u5f88\u5e38\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u683c\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f3c\u4e4e\u592a\u8fc7\u7c97\u7cd9\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6491\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u2026\u2026\u5c31\u5982\u540c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u2018self\u2019\uff08\u81ea\u6211\uff09\u6216\u2018understand\u2019\uff08\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8bcd\u8bed\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u800c\u8a00\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5c1a\u5904\u4e8e\u901a\u5f80\u66f4\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8d77\u6b65\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u201d\u660e\u65af\u57fa\u7ee7\u7eed\u6307\u51fa\uff1a\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u601d\u60f3\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6781\u5ea6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u2026\u2026\u6211\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u5904\u5728\u5173\u4e8e\u5fc3\u667a\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u671f\u3002\u201d \u6211\u4eec\u4eba\u7c7b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002 \u76ee\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u8fd8\u76f8\u8ddd\u751a\u8fdc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6211\u4e0d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fd1\u5728\u773c\u524d\u4e86\u3002\u5982\u679c\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u771f\u7684\u4f1a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6211\u6562\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002 \u4eba\u4eec\u62c5\u5fc3\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u4e8e\u806a\u660e\u5e76\u63a5\u7ba1\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u592a\u611a\u8822\u4e86\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a5\u7ba1\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u3002","title":"One-liner"},{"location":"facts-n-quotes/facts-n-quotes-about-AI/#multi-liner","text":"","title":"Multi-liner"},{"location":"facts-n-quotes/facts-n-quotes-about-AI/#ai-underneath","text":"At a low level, there is no magic in machine learning \u2014 just lots of straightforward mathematics and systems engineering.

high BMI is a risk factor for mortality, even when researchers control for smoking and physical activity, improvementsin mood (the evidence on this is still preliminary, but reasonable).","title":"Meat is Bad for the Climate"},{"location":"facts-n-quotes/facts-n-quotes-about-equality/","text":"Context None yet One-liner Labels are the opposite of understanding \u4eba\u662f\u571f\u5730\u7684\u9644\u5eb8\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4eba\u662f\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u571f\u5730\u4e0a\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7acb\u573a\u89c2\u70b9\u60f3\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u7528\u6765\u8ba8\u8bba\u65cf\u7fa4\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\u3002 \u6b0a\u529b\u3001\u653f\u5e9c\u3001\u4e3b\u6d41\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u7a05\u91d1\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u5df2\u7d93\u662f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u540c\u60c5\u548c\u652f\u6301\u7684\u662f\u5f31\u52e2\u548c\u5c0f\u773e\uff0c\u6c38\u9060\u7ad9\u5728\u5f8c\u8005\u7684\u5c0d\u9762\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u6b0a\u529b\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u5e6b\u51f6\u3002 \u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5973\u6027\u5728\u573a\u3002\u5982\u679c\u90a3\u4e9b\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u4ea7\u751f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u51fa\u81ea\u8eab\u4f53\u5065\u5168\u7684\u767d\u4eba\u7537\u6027\uff08\u4e5d\u6210\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u56fd\uff09\uff0c\u90a3\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\u2014\u2014\u5c31\u50cf\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e0d\u6536\u96c6\u5973\u6027\u8eab\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\u4e00\u6837\u3002 Multi-liner \u666e\u4e16\u4ef7\u503c \u6211\u4eec\u8ffd\u6c42\u666e\u4e16\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u666e\u4e16\u4ef7\u503c\u662f\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4f60\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f60\u5c31\u5e94\u8be5\u62e5\u6709\u4ed6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6709\u4eba\u4e0d\u5e78\u5931\u53bb\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c31\u5e94\u8be5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u3002 \u4ee4\u4eba\u96be\u8fc7\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5ba2\u89c2\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6b64\u611f\u540c\u8eab\u53d7\u3002\u666e\u4e16\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6c11\u65cf\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u548c\u56fd\u7c4d\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5b83\u5c5e\u4e8e\u5168\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u80fd\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4eba\u5c31\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u80fd\u8bc6\u7834\u4e00\u4e9b\u5ef6\u7528\u4e86\u8fd1\u534a\u4e2a\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u53ef\u7b11\u7684\u501f\u53e3\u548c\u8c0e\u8a00\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u88ab\u5bb3\u5984\u60f3\u75c7\u4e5f\u7406\u5e94\u4f1a\u88ab\u6cbb\u6108\u3002 \u5f88\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u6211\u5f97\u4e0d\u5230\u5b83\uff0c\u6211\u672c\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u4e3a\u6b64\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u5199\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u5199\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4e0d\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u96be\u8fc7\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u5e74\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u5230\u73b0\u5728\u3002\u613f\u4e0d\u5728\u610f\u7684\u4eba\u80fd\u4e00\u76f4\u4e0d\u5728\u610f\uff0c\u4ee5\u514d\u906d\u53d7\u8fd9\u79cd\u96be\u8fc7\u3002 \u4eba\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u4e48\u559c\u6b22\u800c\u4e14\u4e60\u60ef\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u52a8\u7269 \u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u5df1\u6240\u5728\u7684\u540c\u7c7b\u91cc\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u82e6\u96be\uff0c\u8981\u653e\u5927\u5230\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e94\u5343\u5e74\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u89c9\u5f97\u81ea\u5df1\u4e5f\u5728\u53d7\u82e6 \u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u82e6\u96be\uff0c\u8981\u5177\u5316\u5230\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u89c9\u5f97\u5bf9\u65b9\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ee3\u8868\u6574\u4f53 \u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cd\u601d\u7ef4\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u5df1\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u2026\u2026\u5509\u3002 \u4eba\u4e4b\u672c \u5728\u8c08\u5230\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14\u4eba\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u9996\u5148\u662f\u6c49\u4eba\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u624d\u662f\u4eba \u5728\u8c08\u5230\u6027\u522b\u8bae\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u9996\u5148\u662f\u7537\u4eba\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u624d\u662f\u4eba \u5728\u8c08\u5230\u9999\u6e2f\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u9996\u5148\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u624d\u662f\u4eba \u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u9996\u5148\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u7537\u6c49\u4eba\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u624d\u662f\u4eba \u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u9a6c\u4e0a\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u5c31\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8df3\u8d77\u6765\u5f00\u59cb\u9a82 On Image Generation and Political Correctness I'm really shocked at the number of people on here who turn into crybabies the moment an unwanted Asian shows up in their image generation results.

Multi-liner Apology Apologize early Recap where you did wrong Promise How you're gonna make it right from now on Vagina Tightness Demystified When a woman is completely aroused and comfortable, the vagina not only lubricates itself, but it lengthens and expands to accommodate a penis. The myth of \u201ctight\u201d and \u201cloose\u201d vaginas is misogynistic bullshit. The vagina is a muscle. It will tighten or stretch to allow any size of penis.

Intimacy happens when somebody shares something emotionally meaningful, and the other person receives it and shares back.

So as you age, and begin to experience these sporadic latencies, take heart: the length of a delay is partly an indicator of the extent of your experience. The effort of retrieval is a testament to how much you know. And the rarity of those lags is a testament to how well you\u2019ve arranged it: keeping the most important things closest to hand. To say something is natural is that it EXISTS, but it doesn\u2019t mean it SHOULD Naturalistic fallacy, which maintains that whatever exists should exist. The naturalistic fallacy confuses a scientific description of human behavior with a moral prescription for that behavior. In nature, however, there are diseases, plagues, parasites, infant mortality, and a host of other natural events that we try to eliminate or reduce. The fact that they do exist in nature does not imply that they should exist. Similarly, male sexual jealousy, which evolved in part as an adaptation to protect men\u2019s certainty of their paternity, is known to damage women worldwide in the form of intimate partner violence, stalking, and occasionally murder. As a society, we may eventually develop methods for reducing male sexual jealousy and its dangerous manifestations. Memory Decline If the fundamental challenge of memory really is one of organization rather than storage, perhaps it should change how we think about the impact of aging on our mental abilities. Recent work by a team of psychologists and linguists led by Michael Ramscar at the University of T\u00fcbingen has suggested that what we call \u201ccognitive decline\u201d\u2014lags and retrieval errors\u2014may not be about the search process slowing or deteriorating, but (at least partly) an unavoidable consequence of the amount of information we have to navigate getting bigger and bigger. Regardless of whatever other challenges aging brings, older brains\u2014which must manage a greater store of memories\u2014are literally solving harder computational problems with every passing day. Through a series of simulations, the researchers showed that simply knowing more makes things harder when it comes to recognizing words, names, and even letters. No matter how good your organization scheme is, having to search through more things will inevitably take longer. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re forgetting; it\u2019s that we\u2019re remembering. We\u2019re becoming archives. Human Behaviors, either Biological or Environmental (We shall) divide human behavior into two separate categories, one biologically determined and the other environmentally determined. In fact, human action is inexorably a product of both. Every strand of DNA unfolds within a particular environmental and cultural context. Within each person\u2019s life, social and phyPsical environments provide input to both the development and activation of evolved psychological adaptations. Every behavior is without exception a joint product of those mechanisms and their environmental influences. \u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u641e\u7838\u4e86 \u4f5c\u5bb6 Anne Lamott \u5728 61 \u5c81\u751f\u65e5\u7684\u524d\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u5199\u4e0b\u4e86\u5341\u4e8c\u6761\u5173\u4e8e\u4eba\u751f\u771f\u76f8\u7684\u7bb4\u8a00\uff0c\u5979\u628a\u67af\u5b50\u53d1\u5e03\u5728\u8138\u4e66\u4e0a\u3002\u4eba\u4eec\u90fd\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8d34\u5b50\u4e95\u75af\u72c2\u8f6c\u53d1\u3002TED \u751a\u81f3\u9080\u8bf7 Anne \u5c31\u8fd9\u5341\u4e8c\u6761\u7bb4\u8a00\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u5341\u4e8c\u6761\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u5c24\u5176\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u641e\u7838\u4e86\uff0c\u7834\u788e\u4e86\uff0c\u7c98\u4eba\u4e86\uff0c\u5bb3\u6015\u4e86\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u662f\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6700\u5f97\u5fc3\u5e94\u624b\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u5979\u4eec\u6bd4\u4f60\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u66f4\u50cf\u4f60\u4e00\u6837\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u5c06\u4f60\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0e\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u5916\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002 \u8fd9\u53e5\u8bdd\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u5e38\u542c\u8bf4\u7684\u4eba\u751f\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f60\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u7236\u6bcd\u53ea\u662f\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f60\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u53ea\u662f\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u3002\u7b2c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f60\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u53ea\u662f\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u3002\u5176\u5b9e\uff0c\u4eba\u751f\u8fd8\u6709\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8fd9\u65f6\uff0c\u4f60\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u3002 \u60f3\u8c61\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u6700\u7fa1\u6155\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u662f\u5de5\u4f5c\u987a\u5229\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u3001\u7f8e\u6ee1\u5e78\u798f\u7684\u540c\u5b66\u3001\u6216\u8005\u662f\u7238\u5988\u5e38\u5938\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\u8868\u54e5\u3002\u4e0d\u7528\u7fa1\u6155\u5979\u4eec\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5149\u9c9c\u7684\u80cc\u540e\uff0c\u5979\u4eec\u90fd\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8ff7\u832b\u548c\u6323\u624e\u3002 \u60f3\u8c61\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u6700\u6028\u6068\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0a\u5904\u5904\u9488\u5bf9\u4f60\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u65e0\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4f60\u7684\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u3002\u4e0d\u7528\u6028\u6068\u5979\u4eec\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u770b\u4f3c\u65e0\u7406\u7684\u5192\u72af\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u5979\u4eec\u91ca\u653e\u81ea\u5df1\u75db\u82e6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002 \u60f3\u8c61\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u6240\u770b\u4f4e\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5979\u4eec\u80f8\u65e0\u5927\u5fd7\u3001\u6d51\u6d51\u5669\u5669\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5979\u4eec\u7eb5\u60c5\u58f0\u8272\u3001\u8086\u610f\u5b89\u4e3a\u3002\u4e0d\u7528\u770b\u4f4e\u5979\u4eec\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5979\u4eec\u7ecf\u5386\u8fc7\u4e0d\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u51b5\u4e14\uff0c\u8c01\u8bf4\u5feb\u4e50\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u4f1a\u6709\u9ad8\u4e0b\u4e4b\u5206\u3002 \u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u540c\u6837\u7684\u75db\u82e6\u3001\u8ff7\u832b\u548c\u6323\u624e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5979\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u591a\u4e48\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u575a\u5f3a\u3001\u4e50\u89c2\u3002\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba (\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u5979\u4eec\u7684\u5185\u5fc3\u4e16\u754c)\uff0c\u90fd\u641e\u7838\u4e86\u3002","title":"Facts n quotes about mind"},{"location":"facts-n-quotes/facts-n-quotes-about-mind/#context","text":"I've attempted to use HI (Human Intelligence, in accordance with AI) at the very outset.

In nature, however, there are diseases, plagues, parasites, infant mortality, and a host of other natural events that we try to eliminate or reduce. The fact that they do exist in nature does not imply that they should exist. Similarly, male sexual jealousy, which evolved in part as an adaptation to protect men\u2019s certainty of their paternity, is known to damage women worldwide in the form of intimate partner violence, stalking, and occasionally murder.

They don\u2019t have the spare resources. It takes a massive toll on their bodies. Wild chickens will lay 10-20 eggs a year. The breeds that lay roughly an egg a day have been naturally selected artificially selected to lay around 200 eggs a year. This is indeed impossible to sustain. In studies, the vast majority of laying hens have bone fractures because those resources weren\u2019t spare. Their bodies can\u2019t support this. The best equivalent (not perfect, but as a simple comparison) is if human women were bred until they have their heaviest day of a period every day. You can imagine that wouldn\u2019t be sustainable. As a result the chickens inevitably burn out and can\u2019t produce at that rate as their bodies deteriorate. And so once they\u2019re not profitable, then they\u2019re sent to the slaughterhouse. Who Once had been in that Head? My most vivid recollection is of one grocery store that, around the Christmas season, featured the severed head of a pig on a table in the middle of an aisle. If you chanced to approach it from the rear, you would see a flat cross-section showing all the inner structures of that pig\u2019s neck, exactly as if it had been guillotined. I couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cWho once had been in that head? Who had lived there? Who had looked out through those eyes, heard through those ears? Who had this hunk of flesh really been?

The breeds that lay roughly an egg a day have been naturally selected artificially selected to lay around 200 eggs a year. This is indeed impossible to sustain. In studies, the vast majority of laying hens have bone fractures because those resources weren\u2019t spare. Their bodies can\u2019t support this. The best equivalent (not perfect, but as a simple comparison) is if human women were bred until they have their heaviest day of a period every day. You can imagine that wouldn\u2019t be sustainable. As a result the chickens inevitably burn out and can\u2019t produce at that rate as their bodies deteriorate.

Like, the speed of light doesn't help us, still to huge, 10x the speed of light . . . nope still to large, on 100x . . . umm, no still take you longer than a human lifetime to get anywhere interesting. We haven't met alien life because for all realistic purposes we live in an endless void, hell our early radio waves still haven't (this might be false, I honestly haven't checked in like a decade) hit anyplace that could have a similar civilization (ie carbon based life forms that work similar to us). Yea a lot of people don't realize that even going 100x light speed (which is impossible as far as we know, without literally bending space itself which we don't know how to do but even if we did would take the mass energy equivalent of all of Jupiter) it would take 2000 years (external observer years, let's not even start down the relativity rabbit hole) to travel across our galaxy\u2026 We'd need a self sustaining generation ship designed to last longer than any civilization has in history\u2026 even at the impossible speed of 100x the speed of light. The reality is we're trapped in our little spacial bubble and every indication points to humanity cooking our little planet under a blanket of greenhouse gasses before we ever even get a chance to reach a level where we have the ability to contemplate operating civilizationally on those kind galactic timescales. Humans \u2014 on the whole \u2014 are angry, brutish, selfish, short-sighted, narrow-minded animals. What would any alien civilization with that kind of capability possibly gain by talking to us? Whether We Were Alone in the Universe Of significance, I note The Dark Forest Theory is not one of the ones in the graphic. Imagine, if you will \u2026 There\u2019s an excellent summary of this theory in the novel The Killing Star by Charles Pellegrino and George Zebrowski, published in 1995. The most pertinent section is: Imagine yourself taking a stroll through Manhattan, somewhere north of 68th Street, deep inside Central Park, late at night. It would be nice to meet someone friendly, but you know that the park is dangerous at night. That\u2019s when the monsters come out. There\u2019s always a strong undercurrent of drug dealings, muggings, and occasional homicides. It is not easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. They dress alike, and the weapons are concealed. The only difference is intent, and you can\u2019t read minds. Stay in the dark long enough and you may hear an occasional distant shriek or blunder across a body. How do you survive the night? The last thing you want to do is shout, \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d The next to last thing you want to do is reply to someone who shouts, \u201cI\u2019m a friend!\u201d What you would like to do is find a policeman, or get out of the park. But you don\u2019t want to make noise or move towards a light where you might be spotted, and it is difficult to find either a policeman or your way out without making yourself known. Your safest option is to hunker down and wait for daylight, then safely walk out. There are, of course, a few obvious differences between Central Park and the universe. There is no policeman . There is no way out .

We haven't met alien life because for all realistic purposes we live in an endless void, hell our early radio waves still haven't (this might be false, I honestly haven't checked in like a decade) hit anyplace that could have a similar civilization (ie carbon based life forms that work similar to us). Yea a lot of people don't realize that even going 100x light speed (which is impossible as far as we know, without literally bending space itself which we don't know how to do but even if we did would take the mass energy equivalent of all of Jupiter) it would take 2000 years (external observer years, let's not even start down the relativity rabbit hole) to travel across our galaxy\u2026 We'd need a self sustaining generation ship designed to last longer than any civilization has in history\u2026 even at the impossible speed of 100x the speed of light. The reality is we're trapped in our little spacial bubble and every indication points to humanity cooking our little planet under a blanket of greenhouse gasses before we ever even get a chance to reach a level where we have the ability to contemplate operating civilizationally on those kind galactic timescales.

Imagine, if you will \u2026 There\u2019s an excellent summary of this theory in the novel The Killing Star by Charles Pellegrino and George Zebrowski, published in 1995. The most pertinent section is: Imagine yourself taking a stroll through Manhattan, somewhere north of 68th Street, deep inside Central Park, late at night. It would be nice to meet someone friendly, but you know that the park is dangerous at night. That\u2019s when the monsters come out. There\u2019s always a strong undercurrent of drug dealings, muggings, and occasional homicides. It is not easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. They dress alike, and the weapons are concealed. The only difference is intent, and you can\u2019t read minds. Stay in the dark long enough and you may hear an occasional distant shriek or blunder across a body. How do you survive the night? The last thing you want to do is shout, \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d The next to last thing you want to do is reply to someone who shouts, \u201cI\u2019m a friend!\u201d What you would like to do is find a policeman, or get out of the park. But you don\u2019t want to make noise or move towards a light where you might be spotted, and it is difficult to find either a policeman or your way out without making yourself known. Your safest option is to hunker down and wait for daylight, then safely walk out. There are, of course, a few obvious differences between Central Park and the universe. There is no policeman . There is no way out .

I purely changed it for the sake of learning. Get the new one created before renaming CREATE DATABASE testdb; Generate the script based on the existing database SELECT CONCAT( 'RENAME TABLE ','`\u65e7\u5e93`','.`',TABLE_NAME, '` TO ','`testdb`.`',TABLE_NAME,'`;' ) FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE table_schema LIKE '\u65e7\u5e93'; Run the script USE `\u65e7\u5e93`; -- the SQL generated from the previous step Table Partitioning Context I wasn't in a position to do this in production, but I still wanted to learn about it. So I got a local MySQL database in Docker and tried it out. all normal CRUDs would be exactly the same if not considering efficient queries. Firstly, it was normally done in the design phase with the table creation so that it knows which table it was operating on. CREATE TABLE Quotes ( row_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, creator VARCHAR(255), quotes VARCHAR(255), created DATE, PRIMARY KEY (row_id, created) ) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(created)) ( PARTITION p2019 VALUES LESS THAN (2020), PARTITION p2020 VALUES LESS THAN (2021), PARTITION p2021 VALUES LESS THAN (2022), PARTITION p2022 VALUES LESS THAN (2023), PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024), PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025) ); Secondly making sure it was properly done, logically, in detail SELECT * FROM information_schema.PARTITIONS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'testdb' AND TABLE_NAME = 'Quotes'; Checking how it was done, physically, in the file system If you were like me, using MySQL Docker and be able to access the container # enter the shell docker exec -it mysql sh # testdb is your database name # quotes is your table name ls /var/lib/mysql/testdb | grep -i quotes # you are expected to see something like this # /var/lib/mysql/testdb/ # \u251c\u2500\u2500 Quotes#P#p2019.ibd # \u251c\u2500\u2500 Quotes#P#p2020.ibd # \u251c\u2500\u2500 Quotes#P#p2021.ibd # \u251c\u2500\u2500 Quotes#P#p2022.ibd # \u251c\u2500\u2500 Quotes#P#p2023.ibd # \u2514\u2500\u2500 Quotes#P#p2024.ibd issues I've faced when operating on an existing table with complex relations (conclusion: not reading the docs long/carefully enough; should have done it in the design phase) Foreign keys are not yet supported in conjunction with partitioning A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table's partitioning function (prefixed columns are not considered). ..
